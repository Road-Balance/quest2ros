1. Install Quest2ROS on your occulus VR headset [https://quest2ros.github.io/q2r-web/](https://quest2ros.github.io/q2r-web/)

2. Clone [ROS TCP enpoint](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Endpoint) into your catkin workspace src

`git clone https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ROS-TCP-Endpoint.git`

3. Clone quest2ros ROS package in your catkin workspace src

`git clone https://github.com/Quest2ROS/quest2ros.git`

4. Build your catkin workspace

`catkin build`

5. Make sure ROS PC and Occulus Headset are on the same (WIFI) network

6. Start ROS TCP endpoint (replace <YOUR_IP>)

7. Set <YOUR_IP> and the same port in the VR and press **apply**

8. You should see [INFO] in the terminal that the connection is established
